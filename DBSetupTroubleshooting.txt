How to set up db so the databaseManager.c will work on your BeagleBone
(Assumes you have installed and instantiated postgresql on your BeagleBone)

change to be postgres user with:

# su - postgres


Create database, user, password:

$ createuser admin_433

$ createdb vending_machine

change to psql console:
$ psql

set password for admin_433:

psql=# alter user admin_433 with encrypted password 'teambato';
	
psql=# grant all privileges on database <dbname> to <username>;


Now do the following
postgres@<yourid>-beagle: psql -U admin_433 -d vending_machine -a -f "<absolute path to setup.sql script>"
or (following assumes setup.sql is copied to your NFS share folder)
psql -U admin_433 -h 127.0.0.1 -d vending_machine -a -f "/mnt/remote/setup.sql"



Troubleshooting

If getting following error when trying to start psql console:

psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory

Is the server running locally and accepting connections on 
Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?



Check what database cluster currently created/running:

# pg_lsclusters


If there is one, but it's not running, then start it (substituting the version and name):

# pg_ctlcluster <x.y> <name> start

(x.y is version number listed in result of pg_lsclusers, for me it was 9.4 main)

If there isn't one, create one and have it started:

# pg_createcluster --start x.y name

If you get error along the lines of 
"Insecure directory in $ENV{PATH} while running with -T switch at /usr/bin/pg_ctlclust"

change permissions to the directory with

If you get an error
	then you need to free up space on the target run:
	#sudo apt-get remove --purge x11-common
	#sudo apt-get autoremove



# chmod 755 /usr/bin
