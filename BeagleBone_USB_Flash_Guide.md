Similar to the official guides, this guide will use the following convention for where you should run commands:

* Commands prefixed by `$` are for the host
Example: `$ echo "This is on the host!"` 

* Commands prefixed by `#` are for the target
Example: `# echo "This is on the target!"` 

* Commands prefixed by `=>` are for use in uboot
Example: `=> echo "This is in uboot!"`
